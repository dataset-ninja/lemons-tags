**lemons tags** is a dataset for instance segmentation and classification tasks. It is used in the agricultural research. 

The dataset consists of 12 images with 37 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *kiwi*, *lemon*, and *cucmber*.

Images in the lemons tags dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 4 (33% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (6 images), *test* (4 images), and *val* (2 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 my split: ***my split 1*** (8 images) and ***my split 2*** (4 images), or into 2 alternative: ***alternative split 1*** (7 images) and ***alternative split 2*** (5 images). Additionally, tra - ta - ta. The dataset was released in 2024 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">test tags</span>.
